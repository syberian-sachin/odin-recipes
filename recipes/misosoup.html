    <h3>This misosoup is made entirely from scratch and has a simple yet complex flavor.You can now enjoy misosoup at home and not just in a japanese restaurant</h3>
    <p>Don't like to start a meal with soup.I much prefer to begin with something light,slightly acidic,and subtly bitter to get the taste buds going,and to further stimulate my appetite.Soups are usually filling,and there's nothing worse,culinarily speaking,than being satiated before the final courses are served.The one huge exception to this would be misosoup.</p>
